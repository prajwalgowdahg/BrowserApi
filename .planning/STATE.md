# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-02)

**Core value:** Callers never write a CSS selector or XPath -- they describe WHAT they want to do, and the API handles HOW.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 - Core Actions with Heuristic Finding

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 6 (Session Management) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase -- COMPLETE
Status: Phase 2 complete, ready for Phase 3
Last activity: 2026-05-04 -- Plan 02-02 completed

Progress: [###░░░░░░░░░] 33%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 1 | 4min | 4min |
| 02-session-management | 2 | 8min | 4min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (4min), 02-01 (4min), 02-02 (4min)
- Trend: Consistent 4-minute velocity

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 6 phases derived from 30 v1 requirements (standard granularity)
- Phase order: Foundation -> Sessions -> Core Actions -> AI Finding -> Compound Actions -> Observability
- ERR-01 (response contract) placed in Phase 1 so all subsequent phases follow the pattern
- DBG-01 (screenshot endpoint) placed in Phase 2 as a session operation
- Used .js extensions in TypeScript imports for NodeNext ESM compatibility (01-01)
- Azure OpenAI fields optional in Phase 1 env schema -- required in Phase 4 (01-01)
- BrowserManager uses module-level singleton state, not a class (02-01)
- Timeout handles use unref() to not block process exit; sweep interval stays live (02-01)
- Route handlers catch capacity errors (429) explicitly, delegate others to Express 5 error middleware (02-02)
- Screenshot route calls sessionManager.touch() before capture to refresh idle timer (02-02)
- Graceful shutdown: sessionManager.shutdown() then closeBrowser() on SIGTERM/SIGINT (02-02)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 (AI Element Finding) is highest risk -- prompt engineering for a11y tree parsing and vision-based element identification needs iterative testing
- Azure OpenAI deployment quotas (TPM/RPM) not yet verified -- depends on subscription tier
